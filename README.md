# README-Generator
Module 9 Challenge
## Description
This project's goal was to use node to help create a markdown generator for README's. Packages included fs and inquirer to be able to run node. Once "node index" is run in the terminal, a series of questions appear for the user input. Once all questions are answered, a new file is created with the questions displayed inside a README markdown.
## Installation
To install, use "git clone" in your command line and copy paste the SSH clone.
Once cloned, make sure to run "npm init -y" to install node and "nmp i" to instill inquirer
## Usage
To start the prompts run "node index" in your command line and answer the questions. Once all questions are complete your README will be complete!
