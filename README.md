# README-Generator
Module 9 Challenge
## Description
This project's goal was to use node to help create a markdown generator for README's. Packages included fs and inquirer to be able to run node. Once "node index" is run in the terminal, a series of questions appear for the user input. Once all questions are answered, a new file is created with the questions displayed inside a README markdown.
